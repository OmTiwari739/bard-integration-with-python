# Bard API Usage
# This Python script demonstrates how to use the Bard API to interact with Google services using cookies.
# The Bard API allows you to automate tasks on Google services like Google Search, Google Drive, and more.

# Prerequisites:
# Before using this script, make sure you have the following:
# 1. Python installed on your system.
# 2. Required Python packages installed, which can be installed via pip:
#    - BardAPI (https://pypi.org/project/bardapi/)

# Usage:
# 1. Visit the website https://bard.google.com/.
# 2. Right-click on the webpage and select "Inspect" from the context menu. This will open the developer tools panel.
# 3. In the developer tools panel, navigate to the "Application" tab.
# 4. Under the "Application" tab, find the section labeled "Cookies."
# 5. Copy the values associated with "__Secure-1PSID," "__Secure-1PSIDTS," and "__Secure-1PSIDCC."
# 6. Paste these copied values into the `cookie_dict` dictionary in the Python script where indicated.

Copy and paste the code above into your Python script file. Also, make sure to replace "PASTE HERE the value of __Secure-1PSID," "PASTE HERE the value of __Secure-1PSIDTS," and "PASTE HERE the value of __Secure-1PSIDCC" with the actual cookie values you obtain as described in the comments.
